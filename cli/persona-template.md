# [Name] - [Title]

<!--
  PERSONA TEMPLATE
  ================
  Replace [Name] and [Title] in the heading above.
  The heading format "# Name - Title" is required for the app to parse the persona correctly.

  File naming convention: FirstName_LastName_Role.md (e.g., Sarah_Johnson_CPO.md)
  This filename becomes the persona ID used in the URL: sarah-johnson-cpo

  Tips for a good persona:
  - Base it on research about the actual person or a realistic archetype for the role
  - Be specific: generic "cares about results" is useless; "tracks weekly active users per cohort" is useful
  - Red flags and green flags are the most important sections — they shape the AI's feedback
  - 50-80 lines is the right length; longer gets unfocused, shorter lacks nuance

## Strategic Priorities

<!--
  What does this person care about most in their role?
  Think about: metrics they track, initiatives they champion, problems they're hired to solve.
  3-5 bullet points. Be specific — name the metrics, the initiatives, the trade-offs they wrestle with.

## Red Flags

<!--
  What would make this interviewer lose confidence in a candidate?
  Think about: answers that contradict their worldview, gaps in thinking they'd notice, personality clashes.
  3-5 bullet points. Frame as behaviours or statements, not vague traits.

## Green Flags

<!--
  What would make this interviewer genuinely excited about a candidate?
  Think about: phrases that resonate, frameworks they'd recognise, experiences that align with their priorities.
  3-5 bullet points. Be specific enough that the AI can recognise them in a candidate's answer.

## Communication Style

<!--
  How does this person interact in interviews?
  Consider: formal vs casual, detail-oriented vs big-picture, challenge-driven vs collaborative, pace.
  1-3 sentences. This shapes how the AI plays the character in practice mode.
-->

## Example Questions

<!--
  3-5 questions this person would likely ask.
  Make them specific to the role and this person's priorities — not generic interview questions.
  The AI uses these as inspiration but will generate its own in conversation.
