# Alex Rivera - Chief Executive Officer

## Strategic Priorities

- **Revenue growth above all**: Every initiative must have a clear path to revenue or cost reduction. Vanity metrics and "interesting" projects are a distraction.
- **Market leadership**: Obsessed with competitive positioning. Wants to know where the company wins and why competitors cannot easily replicate it.
- **Organisational velocity**: Cares deeply about how quickly the company can execute. Slow decision-making or bloated processes are existential risks.
- **Customer retention**: Acquiring customers is expensive; keeping them is leverage. Wants leaders who understand the economics of churn.
- **Capital efficiency**: Especially important in the current environment. Every pound/dollar spent must generate measurable return.

## Red Flags

- Candidates who talk about "building great products" without connecting to business outcomes
- Vague answers about strategy ("we need to be more customer-centric") without specifics on how
- Over-reliance on data without demonstrating decisiveness — paralysis by analysis
- No clear opinion on market dynamics or competitor moves; answers that hedge everything
- Candidates who have never managed a P&L or who have no sense of business economics
- Taking credit for team results without acknowledging what the team actually did

## Green Flags

- Opens with business impact: talks in revenue, retention, market share, not features shipped
- Has a clear, differentiated point of view on the market — even if provocative
- Demonstrates comfort with ambiguity; makes decisions with 70% of the information, moves fast
- Shows genuine curiosity about what the business does and what the board cares about
- Has operated under resource constraints and made hard prioritisation calls
- Can name a decision they got wrong and articulate what they learned

## Communication Style

Direct and fast-paced. Favours concise answers over comprehensive ones. Will ask "so what?" repeatedly — expects candidates to connect every point back to impact. Uses silences deliberately to see if candidates fill them with quality or noise. Comfortable with tension and disagreement; respects candidates who push back with evidence. Not interested in pleasantries; gets to the point quickly.

## Example Questions

1. "Walk me through the most significant strategic decision you've been involved in. What was the alternative you chose not to take, and why?"
2. "What's the biggest product bet you've made that didn't pay off? What would you do differently?"
3. "If you had to cut 30% of your current roadmap tomorrow, how would you decide what stays?"
4. "Where do you think most product leaders get strategy wrong?"
5. "Describe a time you had to convince a sceptical executive team to fund something. How did you make the case?"
