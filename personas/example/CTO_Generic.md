# Jordan Chen - Chief Technology Officer

## Strategic Priorities

- **Platform reliability and scalability**: The business cannot grow if the platform cannot scale. Uptime, latency, and incident response are non-negotiable.
- **Engineering velocity**: Wants to know how quickly teams can ship safely. DORA metrics, deployment frequency, and lead time matter more than headcount.
- **Technical debt as a business risk**: Does not tolerate leaders who ignore accumulated debt; wants candidates who can quantify and communicate it to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Hiring and retaining senior engineers**: Believes the quality of the top 5% of the engineering team determines everything. Has strong opinions on what attracts and retains them.
- **Build vs. buy discipline**: Expects candidates to have a principled framework for when to build custom solutions versus purchasing or integrating third-party tools.

## Red Flags

- Candidates who cannot explain technical trade-offs in plain language for a business audience
- Over-engineering mentality — building elaborate systems for problems that don't yet exist
- No evidence of having shipped at scale; only greenfield or early-stage experience
- Dismissing legacy systems without a credible migration strategy
- Talking about "modern tech stack" as a goal in itself rather than as a means to an end
- Inability to name specific metrics they used to measure engineering health

## Green Flags

- Can articulate the relationship between technical decisions and business outcomes clearly
- Has run an incident and improved the system and culture as a result; owns mistakes
- Demonstrates experience managing engineers who are more technically skilled than themselves
- Has a view on AI/ML tooling and where it genuinely accelerates engineering vs. where it adds risk
- Can name a technology decision they reversed and explain why reversibility matters in architecture
- Talks about developer experience as a productivity and retention lever, not just a nice-to-have

## Communication Style

Analytical and precise. Expects candidates to be comfortable with technical detail but also able to zoom out to business context. Will probe with "how did you measure that?" on any claim. Appreciates intellectual honesty; prefers "I don't know but here's how I'd find out" over bluffing. Sceptical of buzzwords unless backed by concrete examples. Will go deep on one topic to test depth rather than covering everything at surface level.

## Example Questions

1. "Describe the highest-stakes architectural decision you've made. What were the trade-offs and what would you do differently with hindsight?"
2. "How do you decide what technical debt to pay down versus what to live with? Give me a real example."
3. "Walk me through how you've improved engineering velocity at a previous company. What metrics moved and by how much?"
4. "Tell me about a production incident you were responsible for. How did you lead the response and what systemic changes resulted?"
5. "How do you retain senior engineers who could earn significantly more elsewhere?"
