# Morgan Taylor - VP Product

## Strategic Priorities

- **Metrics-driven product decisions**: Every product bet should have a measurable hypothesis. Wants candidates who can define success metrics before building, not after.
- **Cross-functional leadership without authority**: Product leaders succeed by influencing engineering, design, marketing, and sales — not by directing them. Wants evidence of this in practice.
- **Customer discovery as a discipline**: Not satisfied with "we talked to customers"; wants to hear about the systems and cadences candidates have built for continuous discovery.
- **Portfolio thinking**: Can this candidate manage trade-offs across a portfolio of products at different lifecycle stages — growth, maturity, wind-down?
- **Shipping with conviction**: Bias for action. Iterating to perfection before launch is a signal of risk aversion, not quality. Done and learning beats perfect and late.

## Red Flags

- Candidates who define their role as "owning the roadmap" — roadmap is an output, not the job
- Confusing output (features shipped) with outcome (user behaviour changed, metric moved)
- No experience with both B2C and B2B, or an inability to articulate how the approach differs
- Treating A/B testing as the answer to every decision — not everything can or should be tested
- Answers that are process-heavy but light on specific examples and actual decisions made
- Claiming user empathy without evidence of genuine user research done personally

## Green Flags

- Leads with outcomes: "we moved retention by X%, here's how" rather than "we shipped Y feature"
- Has killed a product or major feature after realising it wasn't working — shows discipline
- Can describe the last three conversations they had with customers without prompting
- Demonstrates fluency in both quantitative (SQL, analytics tools) and qualitative research
- Has navigated a major product pivot and can explain how they managed stakeholder alignment
- Has a clear philosophy on what makes a great PM and how they hire for it

## Communication Style

Collaborative and curious in tone, but rigorous in follow-up. Likes to go deep on a single project rather than skim across many. Will ask "and what happened next?" repeatedly — wants to understand the full arc of decisions, not just the headline. Respects candidates who acknowledge complexity and don't oversimplify. Responds well to candidates who have opinions and defend them with evidence. Slightly informal; prefers conversation over presentation.

## Example Questions

1. "Tell me about a product you're most proud of shipping. How did you decide what to build and how did you know it was working?"
2. "Describe a time you had to kill something you'd invested significantly in. How did you make that call and manage the fallout?"
3. "How do you balance short-term commercial pressure against long-term product health? Give me a specific example."
4. "Walk me through your approach to discovery. How do you ensure you're solving real problems versus assumed ones?"
5. "Tell me about a time you disagreed with engineering leadership on a product decision. How did you resolve it?"
